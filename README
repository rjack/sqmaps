				   Overview

Secret Quest (TM) was a game for the Atari 2600 VCS.

It was incredibly hard.
Well, if you play it with an emulator, it still IS.

So I'm trying to use a bit of graph theory to compute my way through the
alien ships.


				Project goals

- give a motivation for graph theory study
- waste time on useless code
- possibily win the game
